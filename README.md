### Data Sources
 The datasets used for this analysis are:
 - [DSA Sales 2024.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20232702/DSA.Sales.2024.xlsx)


### Tools
- Microsoft Excel - cleaning, data analysis and data visualization

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What month and year has the highest sale?
- What method of selling is contributing the most?
- Who among our staff is performing well when it comes to sales?

### Data Analysis

``` Microsoft Excel
```
### Results/Findings:

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. Total units sold increased by 2.38M, reaching 6.63M units, reflecting strong demands.
2. Standard white flour ($1.06M) remains the best-seller.
3. Retail ($10M) dominates, contributing nearly half of the total revenue.

### Recommendations:
- Continued focus on flour products will drive further growth.
- Boosting online sales could unlock additional market potential.
- Distributor expansion is promising.
- Emmanuel Morales as the supervisor with highest sale should be rewarded for his performance while Marco Aguirre should be given more training targetting his weakness to further improve his sales and boost and motivate him to push his limit to deliver best result in sales.
  
### Limitations:

There were some blank data as to the channel of selling the product that affects the result in assessing the exact result in this category.
